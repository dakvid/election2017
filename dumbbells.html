<h2>Explanation</h2>
<p>These dumbbell plots show the percent of the party vote received in each electorate, highlighting the shift from 2014.</p>
<p>National had mostly decreases, with a few small increases.</p>
<p>The Greens had universal decreases, and Labour had corresponding universal increases.</p>
<p>New Zealand First mostly had decreases, some quite large. Apart from the Winston effect in Northland, the most notable increase is in Clutha-Southland, scene of recent controversy.</p>
<p>The Māori Party decreased in six of the Māori seats, but had small gains in South Auckland. ACT pretty much lost all its “large” (1.5-3%) support. And the Conservatives lost all their support!</p>
<p>The final one compares votes for “the Left” (Labour and Green) vs “the Right” (National, ACT and Conservative). Apart from Manukau East, there’s been a universal shift left.</p>
